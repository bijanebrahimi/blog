The List isn't long. same as the last year, I was spending my last months in the military service. I think there are a couple of books missing from the list which I might forgot them for the moment of creating this post. Also I hope I to find the time in the next year to also keep track of the useful articles since I'm mainly reading them instead of hard cover books.

* Head First C
* Scalable C by Pieter Hintjens
